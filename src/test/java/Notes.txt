**************************** Annotations ****************************

* By default, Test cases runs alphabetical order
* By default, test case priority is 0
* @Test: creates test case/method
* @BeforeMethod: same as @Before in junit. runs before each method. Runs before each @Test annotation
* @AfterMethod: same as @After in junit. runs after each method. Runs after each @Test annotation
* @Ignore: to skip a test case
* @Test(enabled = false): to disable test case completely, run button will be gone
* @Test(priority = 1): priority is used for running test in specific order

**************************** Assertions ****************************

==> What is the difference between assertion and verification?
* Assertion means hard assertion. Verification means soft assertion. Verification is similar to if else statement.
* If hard assertion fails, rest of the test case stops.
==> What is the difference between soft assert and hard assert?
* Hard assertion stops execution, after assertion failure. Soft assert continues to execute even after failure
* We need to create a soft assert object to do soft assertion
* assertAll() need to be used in soft assert to make the actual result
==> Which assertion do you prefer? Why?
* I used both. Both assertion are useful. But I used hard assertion the most, because I need to fix the issue the moment it shows up. It usually doesnâ€™t make sense to wait for other tests if there is a failure.
* If there are  lots of test cases , I prefer to use hard assert to find the wrong test case quickly to fix it.
* If I use soft assertion, It will run all the tests every time even there are wrong cases in them. I usually use soft assertion when I write new test cases to see if all good or some fails.

**************************** Read Properties ****************************

==> Why do we use configuration.properties file?
* To store major data in key-value pairs
==> How do we get data from this file?
* We create a java class to read the file with fileinputstream, properties object

**************************** Parallel Testing ****************************

* Main purpose of doing parallel testing is to reduce the testing time
* Sequential testing: tests are running one by one
* Parallel Testing: multiple tests are running same time with different browser
* We use testNG xml files to do parallel testing
* Thread-count: number of thread to run in parallel mode (NEVER put more than 10 thread. Average browser will be 2-3)
* Parallel testing is done for reducing the execution time
* It especially used when running multiple tests that takes long time
